# High Performance Lattice Boltzmann
A high performance lattice Boltzmann fluid simulator operating in 2 dimensions with 9 speeds, optimised for both shared memory & distributed memory platforms as well as homogeneous & heterogeneous platforms. Consisting of separate implementations which together comprise the 3 major parallel programming paradigms of OMP, OCL & MPI. Further detail can be found in the following reports [1](report_1.pdf) [2](report_2.pdf).
